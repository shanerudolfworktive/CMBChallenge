The idea is simple. Nowadays, people tend to jump in a relationship base on their appearance and wonder if the relationship is spiritual. This app works the other way around, you'll get to know their personalities before you see their photo. You'll first read about their introduction before seeing them. If the personality sounds like your type, swipe right to accept and see their picture.

This project uses below technical specifications:

1. Kotlin - the latest language to program in Android
2. RxJava - thread management and easy notification
3. Service - attempt to reloading the photo when the app is connect to wifi and is in battery charging
4. MVVM/Data-Binding - mordening pattern of MVC
5. Espresso - UI automation test
6. Junit - unit test
